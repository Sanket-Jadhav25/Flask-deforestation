Deforestation, as one of the world's challenging natural issues, has been reported as a significant severe risk to the environment and also the highest contributor to changes in land usage. In this project, we will study the spatial arrangement of deforestation using machine learning and satellite imagery. This project will examine the deforestation of different places worldwide using the Landsat and Terra climate dataset via the google earth engine. The aim of the project is to predict the deforestation of any selected region around the world using a machine learning approach.
